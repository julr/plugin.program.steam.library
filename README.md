# Steam Library Add-on for Kodi
This is a very simple Add-on to launch your installed Steam games and Steam itself from Kodi

# Installation
Download this repository as zip file and then install it via the "Install from repository" option within the Kodi Add-on manager ("Unknown sources" must be enabled). See the [Kodi Wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager) for more details.

# Setup
Open the Add-on settings and select your Steam folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Steam\\). Select if you want to download images for the games or not an then click "Scan library...".

# Notes
- This Add-on was developed for Kodi v18 (Leia). I have not tried running it with an earlier version. If you want to try just edit the addon.xml. Any feedback would be appreciated.
- This Add-on was developed under Windows 10 but it does not contain any platform specific code. I don't have a Linux or Mac OS system. Again feedback on compatibility would be appreciated.

# Todo
- [ ] Add support for multiple steam library folders
- [ ] Support for games via In-Home Streaming
